## Flask Application to Implement Airrush Game

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: This will be the main HTML file for the game. It will include the game board, player controls, and game logic.

### Routes

- **@app.route('/')**: This route will handle the initial rendering of the index.html file.
- **@app.route('/move')**: This route will handle the player's move. When the player makes a move, this route will receive the move and update the game state accordingly.
- **@app.route('/check_win')**: This route will check if the player has won the game. When the player makes a move, this route will be called to determine if the game is won.

### Additional Features

- **JavaScript File**: The application will use a JavaScript file for game logic. It will contain functions for handling player moves and checking for wins.
- **favicon.ico**: This file is responsible for displaying a custom icon for the game in the browser tab.
